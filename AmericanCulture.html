        5 Ways to Quickly Adapt to American Culture 
        </h1>

        <h4>
          Coming to a new environment in America can be challenging for many students, and in having a Turkish roommate I have observed the do's and don't for international students.
        </h4>
     <ol>
       <li>
         Get out of your comfort zone to meet non-international students.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Since international students come out to Wash U early and meet each other, it is very easy to just stay friends with those people, but by meeting others you will have a more diverse set of friends that can help you adjust to American life.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
       Work hard, but remember to have fun
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           I see too many international students doing nothing but work. That isn't to say you should go out and get drunk every weekend, but rather put yourself in fun situations where you can enjoy your time. You only get 4 years at this and you can learn a lot as well as have a good time in the process.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Immerse yourself on campus as much as possible
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           By surrounding yourself constantly by Americans and American culture, you will begin to adapt and understand cultural norms. The more time you spend doing so, the easier and better the adjustment will be.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Explore St. Louis
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You get to be in a new country, so try not to stay in the same bubble all of the time. Utilize the metrolink and go exploring different places and eateries in your new city.
