       5 Donts as a new International Student

        <h4>
          There are many mistakes we have observed made by international students during their first year of American college and we want to help you avoid those
        </h4>
     <ol>
       <li>
          Don't only spend time with international students
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           There are so many more people at Wash U, and while it might be easy to avoid them, it will give you the best time at school and will teach you the most.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Don't worry too much about what is going on at home.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           We get that tough things might be going on back home, and that your friends and family miss you, but you are over 1,000 miles away and you have to be able to live in the moment as well and appreciate the place you are in.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Don't overexhaust yourself working.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           School at Wash U is by no means easy, but there is plenty of time to get all of your work done and have time for things like extracurriculars or spending time with friends
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Don't be worried about different norms that you notice.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           If people don't laugh at a joke you make, or you don't understand why people find certain things funny, there is nothing wrong with you, but rather you grew up in a different culture. The more time you spend here the more you will adjust to trends and norms, so don't sweat the little things.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Don't stay uninvolved on campus.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You have a lot to offer to this university, so take full advantage by joining student groups and staying active on campus.
         </li>
