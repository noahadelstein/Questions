        <h4>
          After living with your family for such a large part of your life, it might be a little bit weird to live with other kids of your age, so we have put together a list of ways to adjust smoothly. 
        </h4>
     <ol>
       <li>
        Become friendly enough with your roomate so that you two can be real with each other when you have issues.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You don't want thee type of relationship where you feel uncomfortable asking them to stop turning the lights on at 5am, so creating a good relationship is the first key to a good year.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
    Stay organized
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           It is very easy to lose things in your room if you don't stay organized and having to look for a book or paper due in class five minutes beforehand is not something you want to deal with.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
   Stay hygenic 
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You don't have your mom telling you to brush your teeth and shower each day anymore, so it is entirely on you. But for your sake and the sake of the people you spend time with, stay clean
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
       Make your room yours.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You have an entire year in the place you are staying, so make it your own. Bring posters and pictures you like, and get comfortable in there because you will be spending a lot of time in your room.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
       Take advantage of meeting people on your floor and in your dorm.
       </li>
       <ul>
         When arriving in school, one of the best ways to meet new people is through your floor and more generally dorm. Stop by people's rooms and say hello because you might meet someone you will be friends with for the rest of the year.
