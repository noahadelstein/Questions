          Dear Freshman student,
          <br>
          <br>
          Welcome to Washington University. Your next four years are going to be whatever you choose to make of them. The school puts you in position where it is difficult not to enjoy yourself, but if you are not proactive about having a positive experience here then you might not. College is a time to try new things, push your comfort zones and grow a lot, so take risks and do things you might be too nervous to do otherwise so that by the time you leave college you have no regrets about not doing enough. Here we have put together some tips and advice to help start your college experience and if you have further questions fill out the form on our home page.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hope you have a great semester, 
          <br>
          <br>
          Best, <br> <br>
