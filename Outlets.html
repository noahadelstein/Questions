          Coming to school in a different country can be hard, especially with seemingly nobody to talk to for help, so here's a list of different ways to get help when you need it.
        </h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
         Create relationships with faculty that can help you out
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           By establishing relationships with school professors or other faculty, you will have them to go to when in need of anything. If you don't understand something or are struggling don't feel bad asking for help, that is what many people are here to do.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Establish friendships
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Making friends isn't always the easiest task, but being an international student makes it a little easier because everybody wants to be friends with the guy from "insert country." By having a group of friends you will have another outlet for help
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Your family and friends back home
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Even though the time difference makes it difficult, all of your family and friends back home miss you dearly, so taking the time to talk to them is a great way todiscuss what has been going on in your life.
