        <h4>
During the first few weeks in a new place, it is natural for issues to come up, and since we have had to deal with the same problems, we have outlined them and what to do about them here        </h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
         What happens if you lose your key card or student ID?
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           If you lose your key card: on the S40 there is a 24-hour kiosk in the Res Life Center Annex for you to get a new card. If you live in the Village, there is one open from 8am-5pm each day, and otherwise you have to call 314-935-8828 to get back in the room 
         </li>
         <li>
           If you lose your student ID: You have to go to the Women's Building on campus to the basement floor to get reprinted a new one
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         What happens if you run out of meal points?
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           You can either pay for all of your food with Bear Bucks, or you can buy meal points from another student, but be aware because students are only allowed to transfer meal points once.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        How can you get around St. Louis without having to Uber everywhere?
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           There is the St. Louis metro that all students receive year long passes for. The metro takes you all over St. Louis, and the best places to get on are the U City Big Bend stop (right outside the Village) or the Skinker stop (at the front of campus near Brookings).
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         How do you sign up for classes?
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Talk to your academic advisor and they can help you, but be aware that some classes are difficult to get into so always have backups.
         </li>
       </ul>
