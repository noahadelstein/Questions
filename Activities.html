        <h4>
       Freshman students have the advantage of learning about all of the cool and fun activities that students have to do, but coming in as a transfer, you often don't get the guidance, so we have put it together for you!

     <ol>
       <li>
         Go explore the loop
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           There is some great food on the loop, well enjoyed by many Wash U students. It is a must to go check out during your time at school here.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Go the the big school sponsored events
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Wash U is constantly bringing in cool speakers and performers (especially during WILD), so make sure you go those types of things, because they are always a blast.

Explore the different places to eat on campus       </li>
<ul>
  <li>
    Many who don't know much about campus will eat at the same boring places each day on campus, but check out Holmes Lounge, the Law School Cafe and Lopata for other good food on campus.
  </li>
</ul>
       <li>
Go to the big events happening in St. Louis
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           St. Louis Mardi Gras is the second biggest in the country, there are great Oktoberfest events, and if you're in town for St. Patrick's day, check that stuff out too.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Check out the club seen (maybe?)
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           There are some people that are not into the club and dancing scene in St. Louis at all, but many students are, so keep up to date with TSE and Pyramid Promotion events because many Wash U students will be there.
