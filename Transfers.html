          Dear Transfer Student, 
         <br>
         <br>
         Welcome to Wash U! The school could not be happier to have you on campus with us and we hope that the next few years here will be memorable for you. Regardless of what brought you to transfer here, you should aim to focus on being here now and doing what you can to enjoy the rest of your college experience. Our advice: get involved and immersed into campus quickly. You can read some of our tips for how to do so, but the biggest limitation will be yourself. Push your limits and make this experience a great one because it is already partially over. 
         <br> <br>
         We hope you have a great semester and if you have further questions fill out the form on our home page. 
         <br> <br>
         Best, <br> <br>
Wash U new students team
