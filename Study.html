        <h4>
          Being new to campus comes with being unfamiliar with the buildings and best locations, so instead of spending time wandering around to find the best and most quiet areas to study, we have put them together for you
        </h4>
     <ul>
      <li>
         East Asian Library
         <ul>
          <li>The East Asian Library is located in Brookings Quad. The library is on the second floor of the building and it is always absoutely silent and rarely ever crowded. </li> 
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
         Music Library
         <ul>
          <li>The Music Library is located on the front of campus near Simon Hall. There is rarely anyone there, and the vibes are very laid back.  </li> 
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
         Olin Library
         <ul>
          <li>Olin Library is the most well known and crowded library on campus. It sits in the middle of campus with multiple floors organized by noise level. </li> 
         </ul>
       </li><li>
         Ursas
         <ul>
          <li>On the 40 of campus is Ursas, a quiet location near the main dinery, Bear's Den. There are often not too many people in Ursas and always open tables. If there isn't an event going on there, it's a good place to work with friends. </li> 
         </ul>
       </li><li>
         Study rooms
         <ul>
          <li>All over campus are small study rooms. From the dorms to many of the buildings to some fraternity houses, small study rooms are everywhere. </li> 
         </ul>
       </li>
     </ul>
