           Dear International Student,
         <br>
         <br>
Welcome to St. Louis. International students are some of the most diverse and unique people on campus, and you all are the next generation of them. We implore you throughout the year to meet a lot of new people and work to understand American culture. It will not only teach you a lot, but make your time more fun and memorable on campus. We understand the transition might be difficult, so if you need any sort of help feel free to reach out. We hope, though, that some of the information on this site will be able to aid you in your transition to school here.

         <br> <br>
         We hope you have an amazing semester and look forward to hearing about your experiences soon.
         <br> <br>
         Best,
         <br> <br>
