          Coming into a new environment where a lot of people already have established friends can be difficult, so we have compiled a list of ways to get involved in the social scene quick!

       Gargoyle Happy Hour
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Every Thursday at 5:30 in the Gargoyle there is a happy hour for students to hang out, drink some beer (if you're old enough!) and meet new people.

         Greek life
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           If you are a freshman or sophomore and are intersted in Greek life then you should absolutey go for it. It is a great place to meet a lot of new people that you will able to call close friends.

      Wash U sponsored events
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Some events are much more well attended than others, but in general when Student Union puts on events you can go and meet new people. There are big events like WILD and smaller ones like speed dating.
         </li>

       <li>
      Get involved in student groups
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           We discuss this more <a href = "http://noahadelstein.github.io/Questions/Involvement.html" target = "_blank" >here,</a> but getting involved in student groups provides an instantaneous way to meet new people that you can connect with.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Don't be afraid to meet people on your floor/in your area of living.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Although it is a classic freshman fall move to go around knocking on doors, being a new student you have a good reason to do the same. If you tell someone you just transfered and were trying to meet new people they would not look down on you, and it could provide you with new friendships.
