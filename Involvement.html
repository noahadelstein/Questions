        <h4>
          Making friends and knowing what to do can be difficult, but people often underestimate the difficulties of becoming active on campus as a transfer student, so if you follow these tips it should be easy!
        </h4>
     <ol>
       <li>
        Befriend those who are already involved in interesting things
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           By finding friends who have multiple involvements you can find things you might be interested in and then you have people to go with.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Go to the activities fair
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           During activities fair, each group showcases themselves and you can find the ones that interest you most.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
Spend the necessasry time finding the groups for you       </li>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is easy to join the first few groups you are exposed to, but those might not be the most interesting and best fits for you, so really do spend the time picking the right ones.
  </li>
</ul>
       <li>
        If the group is selective get advice about how to get chosen
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Unfortunately there are some groups on campus that not everybody gets into, and if you are intersted in one of those then definitely go for it, ask around to get help trying to get in, and if you don't then no worries!
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Look into research/a campus job
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           If you are trying to make money or are intersted in research then look into getting a job at Wash U. It isn't overly difficult if you put in the time to apply and find good positions.
