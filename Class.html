        <h4>
          College classes are entirely different from those in high school, and being thrown in is difficult for many students, so here are ways to prepare for the challenges to come.
        </h4>
     <ul>
       <li>
         Stay on top of your schoolwork.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           It is very easy to fall behind in school by not doing the readings or homeworks. Doing this will make it extremely challenging to catch up though, so stay on top of everything.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
         Keep a planner or to do list.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           In high school there was not enough going on for many people to need something that would keep track of the things they had to do, but in college there will be. So don't be stubborn about wanting to remember everything, just write stuff down.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
        Work really hard during your first semester.
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           By working your butt off in your first semester you will not only keep your parents happy, but you will get a feel for what you need to do in college to do well in classes. It is the best way to help adjust. 
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
       Meet with professors when needed
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           It can definitely be a hassle to have to go into office hours for a teacher, but by doing that they can give you help  on things you are struggling with and they can get to know you, something very valuable if you were to need a recommendation.
         </li>
       </ul>
       <li>
      Find study partners
       </li>
       <ul>
         <li>
           Many classes are difficult and finding others in your class that you can do work with and study for tests with can be extremely valuable.
         </li>
